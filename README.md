#### Description:A maintenence organizer and communications webpage

My cs50 final project called FleeVison is meant for companies that deal with many vehicles constanly needing maintenence and also gives comunication strenght to supervisors.
The webpage has a few pages making it as minimal as it can be for users who are constantly needing to move from locations to be able to report problems between stops or when pulled over.
This makes it easier to report a problem instead of waiting until you see a supervisor to inform them wich by then many drivers forget or do not bother to bring up maintenence.
Nothing too big for information just to the point so drivers can keep moving and dont think its too complicated or time consuming.
All of this while giving supervisors a page to themselves were things drivers do not need to see can still be at everyones fingertips werever they are.

My Home page:
The home page is meant to display news and updates for whole companies to see. This section is meant to connect everyone and keep information at one spot easy to find.
Many opportunities to make messages public , give warnings to drivers for weather conditions and display employee progress.
people can hear about top drivers and company status , company/employee rankings. Updates on competitiveness and prize winners possibly.
Also people can stay in touch as to what is going on nationally with companies.

Compose:
Compose is meant to be the center of it all , simple and to the point because drivers are constanly mobing and many just want to get home so minutes are very crucial to employees.
By making this as basic as it can be it motivates people to stop for just a few seconds. The compose page sends all entries to the ID user 1 wich is the main account for fleet Maintenence Mechanics or assigned supervisors.
Van section only allows input of digits toonly take in van numbers. Text field takes up to 200 characters to prevent unessesary messages and only accept basic to the point maintenence.

Sent:
sent page shows what entries the user logged in has sent giving them the aility to retract previously made maintenence requests incase a problem was not so big afer all or no longer needed.

Inbox:
Inbox is for admin with id of 1 to receive all sent entries without drivers needing to choose were it goes. automatically the admin account will see messages displaying the van number and date sent
 wich will have the button View Entry

 Entry:
 once View Entry has been clicked the admin can see the user who sent the entry to identify who it is if needed on additional information on what the problem is or for help on recreating certain issues.
 This page shows who sent it, the date it was sent, aswell as vehicle number and explination of the issue/maintenence.

 Admin:
 My admin page is were the supervisors with admin accounts will be able communicate and display constant information needed.
 Admin page has a wall for supervisors to post long term uodates or reminders for eachother so that the need to text or call every supervisor will no longer be needed. this will show and display to everyone who needs the ability to
 access quick information at one spot. People will be able to leave long term reminders all conviniently in a quick access webpage.

My thoughts on the design, i chose to make it simple because in a work enviorment were nothing stops it is important for users to have something minimal and to the point. I chose to make the webiste with pop out colors to make up for the minimalism so that it looks pleasing to the eye and has a clean look but also profesional.
