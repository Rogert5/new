sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort moves the highest valued element to the right. making a sorted order of text easier to prove.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Merge sorts left half then the right half of the array. Then merges both halves. this is the quickest algorithm
with a sorted list, and also slowest when reversed. So to me this both confirms a Merge sort best with a random list.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort find smallest unsorted element and adds it to the end of the sorted list.
